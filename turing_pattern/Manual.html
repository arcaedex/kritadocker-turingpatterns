<h3>Turing Patterns</h3>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_pattern
<h3>Usage</h3>
I haven't done a krita plugin before so it's likely that there are bugs. This is Inspired by @TickFleato's tumblr tutorial on creating turing patterns in photoshop!
<br>Start out with lines drawn on a solid background, in black and white absolutes. 
The high pass value roughly determines line width, and the gaussian blur value roughly determines growth patterns.
<br> WARNING: It is important NOT to click the iteration button too quickly or else Krita may crash! The function is slower on bigger canvases.
