# kritadocker-turingpatterns
A rudimentary krita docker that allows the user to generate iterations of turing patterns on their current layer!
# Implementation
Navigate to Krita/share/krita/pykrita and place the .desktop file and turing_pattern folder there.
when opening krita you'll have to enable the plugin through the plugin manager in krita's settings, and then close out and reopen the program
