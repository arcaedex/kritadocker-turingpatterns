# kritadocker-turingpatterns
A rudimentary krita docker that allows the user to generate iterations of turing patterns on their current layer! Inspired by @tickfleato's photoshop tutorial
# Implementation
Navigate to Krita/share/krita/pykrita and place the .desktop file and turing_pattern folder there.
when opening krita you'll have to enable the plugin through the plugin manager in krita's settings, and then close out and reopen the program.
When using the single iteration button be aware that repeated clicking without breaks could crash Krita. A larger document may slow down generation times
