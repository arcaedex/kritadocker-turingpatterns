# kritadocker-turingpatterns
A rudimentary krita docker that allows the user to generate iterations of turing patterns on their current layer!
# Implementation
navigate to Krita/share/krita/pykrita and place the .desktop file there
create a folder named turing_pattern and put all the other files in it
when opening krita you'll have to enable the plugin through the plugin manager in krita's settings, and then close out and reopen the program
